Transcriber's note:

      [ae] and [oe] are used for the diphthongs/ligatures in (mostly)
      French words. (e.g. c[oe]ur, heart; s[oe]ur, sister; ch[oe]ur;
      choir).

      The original page headings have been retained and moved to
      appropriate positions at the beginning of letters and text to
      which they refer, so as not to interrupt the flow of the text.
      Thus, a long letter may be prefaced by two, or even three
      page headings. Likewise, footnotes have been moved to the end
      of the appropriate letter, or the appropriate paragraph in the
      case of longer pieces of text.

      In the text file version, for "See _ante_/_post_, p. xyz", the
      date and note number (where applicable) have been given instead
      of the page number, for easier reader look-up.


      INDEX

      Page numbers have been adjusted to allow for the re-positioning
      of footnotes. Other (numerous) page numbering errors have been
      corrected.

      A list of corrections will be found at the end of the text.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE

TO CHAPTER XXIII


At the meeting of Parliament, on the 31st of January 1854, the
Ministry were able triumphantly to refute the charge of illegitimate
interference in State affairs which had been made by a section of the
Press against Prince Albert; they were, however, severely attacked for
not acting with greater vigour in Eastern affairs. In February, the
Russian Ambassador left London, the Guards were despatched to the
East, and the Russian Government was peremptorily called upon by Great
Britain and France to evacuate the Principalities. The Peace Party,
Bright, Cobden, and others, were active, but unheeded; the Society of
Friends sending a pacific but futile deputation to the Czar. In March,
the demand for evacuation being disregarded, war was declared, and a
treaty of alliance signed between England and France; Lord Raglan and
Marshal St Arnaud were appointed to command the respective armies,
Vice-Admiral Sir James Dundas and Sir Charles Napier having command
of the Mediterranean and Baltic Fleets respectively. The attitude of
Austria was ambiguous, and, after England and France were committed to
war, she contracted an offensive and defensive alliance with Prussia,
each country engaging to make limited preparations for war. At home,
with a view to greater efficiency, the duties of the Secretary
of State for War and the Colonies, till then united in a single
Secretaryship, were divided, the Duke of Newcastle assuming the former
office, while Sir George Grey became Colonial Secretary; Lord John
Russell also resumed office as President of the Council. The Russians
were unsuccessful in their operations against the Turks, notably at
Silistria and Giurgevo, while, as the summer advanced, public opinion
in support of an invasion of the Crimea rose steadily, the _Times_
indicated the taking of Sebastopol as indispensable, and Lord
Aberdeen's hand was forced. On the 28th of June, the Cabinet
sanctioned a despatch to Lord Raglan, urging (almost to the point of
directing) an immediate attack upon Sebastopol; the French Emperor
was in favour of the plan, though both Commanders-in-Chief entertained
doubt as to whether it was immediately feasible. On the 7th of
September, the allied forces (58,000 strong) sailed from Varna, a
landing being effected a few days later at Old Fort, near Eupatoria;
at about the same time an important interview took place at Boulogne
between Prince Albert and the Emperor Napoleon. The signal victory at
the Alma, on the 20th of September, was followed by the death of St
Arnaud, and the appointment of Canrobert as his successor. Decisive
successes were next obtained at Balaklava on the 25th of October, and
at Inkerman on the 5th of November; but on the 14th a fierce gale did
immense damage to life and property, both at Balaklava and on the
sea. Meanwhile, indignation at home was aroused by the tidings of
the breakdown of the commissariat and transport departments, and the
deplorable state of the hospitals; Miss Florence Nightingale, who had
sailed from England with a number of nurses, arrived at Scutari early
in November, and proceeded to remedy deficiencies as far as possible;
while Lord John Russell vainly urged on the Premier the substitution
of Lord Palmerston for the Duke of Newcastle as Secretary for War.
Sir Charles Napier, who, previously to his departure with the Baltic
Fleet, had been fêted at the Reform Club, and extravagantly lauded
by Cabinet Ministers, was by the month of October engaged in a
recriminatory correspondence with the First Lord of the Admiralty.
At about the same time the Patriotic Fund was established under the
presidency of Prince Albert.

In Parliament, the last vestige of the old Navigation System, limiting
the coasting trade to British ships, was repealed, and a Bill also
passed for preventing corrupt practices at elections. Owing to the
war, the Reform Bill was withdrawn, Lord John Russell, on announcing
the fact in Parliament, being overcome, and giving way to tears.
In the short session, which took place during the latter half of
December, a Foreign Enlistment Act was passed, providing for a force
of 10,000 foreigners, to be drilled in this country.

The Exhibition Building, which had been constructed in Hyde Park
in 1851, and had been re-erected at Sydenham, was opened with great
ceremony by the Queen, and was henceforth known as the Crystal Palace.
