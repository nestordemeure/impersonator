INTRODUCTORY NOTE

TO CHAPTER XIII


The new year (1844) opened with signs of improved trade, and a feeling
of confidence, partly due to the friendly _entente_ with France. In
Ireland, soon after the collapse of the Clontarf meeting, O'Connell
and some of his associates were indicted for seditious conspiracy,
and convicted. The conviction was subsequently quashed on technical
grounds, but O'Connell's political influence was at an end. In
Parliament, owing chiefly to the exertions of Lord Ashley (afterwards
Earl of Shaftesbury), an important Bill was passed restricting factory
labour, and limiting its hours. The Bank Charter Act, separating the
issue and banking departments, as well as regulating the note issue
of the Bank of England in proportion to its stock of gold, also
became law. Meanwhile the dissensions in the Conservative party were
increasing, and the Ministry were defeated on a motion made by their
own supporters to extend the preferential treatment of colonial
produce. With great difficulty the vote was rescinded and a crisis
averted; but the Young England section of the Tory party were becoming
more and more an embarrassment to the Premier. Towards the end of
the year the new Royal Exchange was opened amid much ceremony by the
Queen.

The services rendered by Sir Charles Napier in India were the subject
of votes of thanks in both Houses, but shortly afterwards Lord
Ellenborough, the Governor-General, was recalled by the Directors
of the East India Company: their action was no doubt due to his
overbearing methods and love of display, but it was disapproved by the
Ministry, and Lord Ellenborough was accorded an Earldom.

During the year there was a recrudescence of the friction between this
country and France, due partly to questions as to the right of search
of foreign ships, partly to a _brochure_ issued by the Prince de
Joinville, a son of Louis Philippe, partly to the assumption of French
sovereignty over Tahiti and the seizure of the English consul there
by the French authorities. Reparation however was made, and the
ill-feeling subsided sufficiently to enable the King of the French to
visit Queen Victoria,--the first friendly visit ever paid by a
French king to the Sovereign of England. Louis Philippe was cordially
received in this country.

Another historic royal visit also took place in 1844, that of the
Emperor Nicholas, who no doubt was so much impressed with his friendly
reception, both by the Court and by Aberdeen, the Foreign Secretary,
that nine years later he thought he could calculate on the support of
England under Aberdeen (then Premier) in a scheme for the partition
of Turkey. Lord Malmesbury, who a few years later became Foreign
Secretary, states in his memoirs that during this visit, the Czar, Sir
Robert Peel, the Duke of Wellington, and Lord Aberdeen "drew up and
signed a Memorandum, the spirit and scope of which was to support
Russia in her legitimate protectorship of the Greek religion and
the Holy Shrines, and to do so without consulting France," but
the Memorandum was in reality only one made by Nicholas of his
recollection of the interview, and communicated subsequently to Lord
Aberdeen.

No events of special interest took place in other parts of Europe;
the condition of affairs in the Peninsula improved, though the
announcement of the unfortunate marriage of the Queen Mother with
the Duke of Rianzares was not of hopeful augury for the young Queen
Isabella's future; as a matter of fact, the marriage had taken place
some time previously.
