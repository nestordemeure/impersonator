Title: Leaves from the Journal of our Life in the Highlands, from 1848
       to 1861
Author: Victoria, Queen of Great Britain


EDITOR’S PREFACE.

The circumstances which have led to the publication of this Volume are,
briefly, these.

During one of the Editor’s official visits to Balmoral, her Majesty
very kindly allowed him to see several extracts from her journal,
relating to excursions in the Highlands of Scotland. He was much
interested by them; and expressed the interest which he felt. It then
occurred to her Majesty that these extracts, referring, as they did,
to some of the happiest hours of her life, might be made into a book,
to be printed privately, for presentation to members of the Royal
Family and her Majesty’s intimate friends; especially to those who had
accompanied and attended her in these tours.

It was then suggested to her Majesty by some persons, among them a near
and dear relative of the Queen, and afterwards by the Editor, that this
work, if made known to others, would be very interesting to them as
well as to the Royal Family and to her Majesty’s intimate friends. The
Queen, however, said, that she had no skill whatever in authorship;
that these were, for the most part, mere homely accounts of excursions
near home; and that she felt extremely reluctant to publish anything
written by herself.

To this the Editor respectfully replied, that, if printed at all,
however limited the impression, and however careful the selection of
persons to whom copies might be given, some portions of the volume, or
quite as probably incorrect representations of its contents, might find
their way into the public journals. It would therefore, he thought, be
better at once to place the volume within the reach of her Majesty’s
subjects, who would, no doubt, derive from it pleasure similar to that
which it had afforded to the Editor himself. Moreover, it would be very
gratifying to her subjects, who had always shown a sincere and ready
sympathy with the personal joys and sorrows of their Sovereign,--to
be allowed to know how her rare moments of leisure were passed in
her Highland home, when every joy was heightened, and every care and
sorrow diminished, by the loving companionship of the Prince Consort.
With his memory the scenes to which this volume refers would always be
associated.

Upon these considerations her Majesty eventually consented to its
publication.

While the book was being printed, the Editor suggested that it would
gain in interest if other extracts were added to it, describing her
Majesty’s progresses in England, Ireland, and the Channel Islands.

The Queen was pleased to assent; and the additions were accordingly
made.

       *       *       *       *       *

It will easily be seen that this little work does not make any
pretension to be more than such a record of the impressions received by
the Royal Author in the course of these journeys, as might hereafter
serve to recall to her own mind the scenes and circumstances which
had been the source of so much pleasure. All references to political
questions, or to the affairs of Government, have, for obvious reasons,
been studiously omitted. The book is mainly confined to the natural
expressions of a mind rejoicing in the beauties of nature, and
throwing itself, with a delight rendered keener by the rarity of its
opportunities, into the enjoyment of a life removed, for the moment,
from the pressure of public cares.

       *       *       *       *       *

It would not be becoming in the Editor to dwell largely upon the merits
of this work. He may, however, allude to the picturesque descriptions
of scenery in which the work abounds; to the simplicity of diction
throughout it; and to the perfect faithfulness of narration which
is one of its chief characteristics; for in every page the writer
describes what she thinks and feels, rather than what she might be
expected to think and feel.

Moreover, he may point out the willingness to be pleased, upon which
so much of the enjoyment of any tour depends: and also the exceeding
kindliness of feeling--the gratitude even--with which the Royal
Tourists recognize any attention paid to them, or any manifestation
of the cordial attachment felt towards them, by any of her Majesty’s
subjects, from the highest to the humblest, whom they happen to meet
with in the course of their journeys.

       *       *       *       *       *

The Editor thinks that he should not be doing justice to the Royal
Author’s book--not doing what, if it were any other person’s work which
was entrusted to his editing, he should do--if he were to forbear
giving utterance to the thoughts which occurred to him in reference to
the notes to the Volume.

These notes, besides indicating that peculiar memory for persons,
and that recognition of personal attachment, which have been very
noticeable in our Sovereigns, illustrate, in a striking manner, the
Patriarchal feeling (if one may apply such a word as “patriarchal” to a
lady) which is so strong in the present occupant of the Throne. Perhaps
there is no person in these realms who takes a more deep and abiding
interest in the welfare of the household committed to his charge than
our gracious Queen does in hers, or who feels more keenly what are the
reciprocal duties of masters and servants.

Nor does any one wish more ardently than her Majesty, that there should
be no abrupt severance of class from class, but rather a gradual
blending together of all classes,--caused by a full community of
interests, a constant interchange of good offices, and a kindly respect
felt and expressed by each class to all its brethren in the great
brotherhood that forms a nation.

Those whose duty it has been to attend upon the Queen in matters of
business, must have noticed that her Majesty, as a person well versed
in the conduct of affairs, is wont to keep closely to the point at
issue, and to speak of nothing but what is directly connected with
the matter before her. But whenever there is an exception to this
rule, it arises from her Majesty’s anxious desire to make some inquiry
about the welfare of her subjects--to express her sympathy with this
man’s sorrow, or on that man’s bereavement--to ask what is the latest
intelligence about this disaster, or that suffering, and what can be
done to remedy or assuage it--thus showing, unconsciously, that she is,
indeed, the Mother of her People, taking the deepest interest in all
that concerns them, without respect of persons, from the highest to the
lowest.

       *       *       *       *       *

The Editor thinks that one point of interest which will incidentally
be disclosed by this publication, is the aspect of the Court in these
our times. What would not the historian give to have similar materials
within his reach, when writing about the reigns of the great Queen
Elizabeth or the good Queen Anne? There is always something in the
present which has the appearance of being trivial and prosaic; but the
future historian will delight in having details before him furnished by
this book and by the _Life of the Prince Consort_[1], which will enable
him fully to describe the reign of Victoria, and justly to appreciate
the private life of a Sovereign whose public life will enter so largely
into the annals of the nineteenth century.

[1] A work which has met with a very cordial reception from the
public, and which, from what the Editor has seen, will not by any means
diminish in interest as it proceeds to describe the full and busy life
of the Prince as a man.

One more remark the Editor cannot refrain from making; namely, that
it is evident that her Majesty never takes for granted the services
and attentions which are rendered to her, and which we all know would
be rendered to her from dutiful respect and regard, but views them as
especial kindnesses shown to herself, and to which she makes no claim
whatever from her exalted position as a Sovereign.

This latter trait, very characteristic of the Royal Author, gives,
throughout, an additional charm to the book, which, on that account
alone, and apart even from its many other merits, will, the Editor
doubts not, be gratefully and affectionately welcomed by the public.
