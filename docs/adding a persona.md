# Adding a persona

To add a persona, add a subfolder in the `personas` folder.

## Folder organization

Your subfolder should:
- be named like your persona (i.e. `John Doe`)
- include texts written by them (if possible non-fiction, correspondence would be best) in a `texts` subfolder (common formats such as `.txt`, `.html`, `.docx` should work fine, you might have to convert other formats).

To reload a persona from scratch (taking into account new files), delete the `index.faiss` and `index.pkl` files in its folder.

See the `John Doe` folder for a small example.

## File conversion

txt
docx
html
epub
pdf

## What to use

blog
non-fiction especialy autobiographies and self-help books (which are often written in the first person)
yourself (extracting all your messages from social media or using your journals)
your own fictional character
